# BeeMovieScript
This python program can type out and (if you want to) send every line from the bee movie script to a victim word by word. I didn't feel motivated to add a UI but a future update wil bring a UI and options between several different pop culture scripts including but not limited to: The Shrek Franchise, The Barbie Franchise, Hamilton, and even the option to import your own scripts

Before using please unzip the script.zip, which holds the bee movie script. Alternatively unzip the already built version (Inside "Bee Movie Messenger.zip") and use the application file in there.
