# BeeMovieScript
This python program can type out and (if you want to) send every line from the bee movie script to a victim WORD BY WORD. I didn't feel motivated to add a UI but a future update wil bring a UI and options between several different pop culture scripts including but not limited to: The Shrek Franchise, The Barbie Franchise, Hamilton, and even the option to import your own scripts
